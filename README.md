# Stonepedia Homepage Redesign

## Objective

The goal of this project is to **redesign the homepage of [Stonepedia](https://stonepedia.in/)** with a fresh, creative, and innovative layout that enhances user experience and modernizes the design. This will be a **front-end only** project, and the final version will be deployed on a platform like **Vercel** or **Netlify**. The redesign will take inspiration from modern web design trends and will avoid mimicking the current homepage to foster originality.
